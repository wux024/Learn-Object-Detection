# Learn-Object-Detection
This task is mainly divided into three steps for target detection. The first step is to use OpenCV's DNN module or the reasoning function of other deep learning frameworks, and borrow weight files trained by other researchers to achieve the task of target detection. The second step is mainly to use the pre-training model to fine-tune to obtain the target detection model related to the task, and to achieve the target detection task. The third step is to use the deep learning framework to build a target detection model from 0 to 1, and complete the target detection task.
The weight file used in the code can be downloaded from the website.
